    <h2> What Is Tiramisu?</h2>
    <p>Tiramisu is a coffee-flavored dessert that features layers of homemade whipped cream, an egg yolk-enriched mascarpone filling, and coffee-soaked ladyfingers.</p>
    <h3> Tiramisu Origin</h3>
    <p>Tiramisu has Italian origins. The famous Italian restaurateur Ado Campeol is credited with its invention in the 1970s. In fact, he was widely known as "the father of tiramisu." The word "tiramisu" translates to "pick-me-up."</p>
    <h3> Tiramisu Pronunciation    </h3>
    <p>Not sure how to pronounce tiramisu? Order in confidence by saying "tee-ruh-mee-soo."</p>
    <h3> Does Tiramisu Have Alcohol?</h3>
    <P> Tiramisu usually contains alcohol. Marsala wine is the traditional choice, but this recipe calls for a mixture of strong coffee and rum. If you prefer not to use alcohol, just leave it out. It will still be delicious with just the coffee alone (just make sure the coffee is extra strong).</P>
    <h2> Tiramisu Ingredients</h2>
    <p> Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated tiramisu recipe:<p>
    <p><ul>
        <li><strong>Egg Yolks:</strong> Egg yolks are essential for a thick, rich, velvety smooth filling. Though some traditional recipes use raw eggs, this one doesn't — raw eggs carry the risk of food-borne illness.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> White sugar is cooked with egg yolks and combined with mascarpone to create a sweet, creamy filling.</li>
        <li> <strong> Milk:</strong> Whole milk slightly thins the thick filling, resulting in a spreadable texture.</li>
        <li> <strong>Cream:</strong> Beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form to create an irresistible whipped cream.</li>
        <li> <strong>Vanilla:</strong>Vanilla extract adds subtle flavor to the homemade whipped cream.        </li>
        <li> <strong>Mascarpone: </strong> Mascarpone, a creamy Italian cheese with a smooth texture and fresh taste, is a key ingredient in classic tiramisu.</li>
        <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Ladyfingers are soaked in strong, spiked coffee — this is what gives tiramisu its signature flavor.</li>
        <li> <strong>Rum:</strong> Dark rum is mixed with the coffee for soaking the ladyfingers. You can substitute with Marsala wine or omit for a non-alcoholic version.</li>
        <li> <strong>Ladyfingers:</strong> Crisp Italian ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi) form the layers of the dessert and soak up the coffee mixture.</li>
        <li> <strong>Cocoa Powder:</strong> Unsweetened cocoa powder is dusted over the top for a classic finish and a hint of chocolate flavor.</li>
    </ul> </p>
